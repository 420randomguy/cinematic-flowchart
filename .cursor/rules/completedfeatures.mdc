# Rule

- When user confirms a feature works, add it to the role below into the # Features section.
- Do not attempt to change features. If change is necessary, then you must ask for permission from a user.

# Features

- Core node connection logic in useFlowchartStore.ts
- Node type definitions in dynamic-node-types.ts
- Keep node-related logic in designated files
- Follow the established node connection system
- Respect the connection validation rules
- Core node connection logic works in useFlowchartStore.ts
- Node type definitions work in dynamic-node-types.ts

# VisualMirror System

## Core Functionality
- VisualMirror displays content from the visual mirror store based on nodeId
- Content types: text and image, which must work independently
- Three component variants: VisualMirrorImage, VisualMirrorText, and VisualMirror (both)

## Implementation Rules
- Keep logic simple - direct checks for content existence
- No interdependency between text and image content
- Must preserve both text and image when either is updated
- Store operations must merge content, not replace

## Content Management
- Content updates are handled by useVisualMirrorStore
- The store merges new content with existing content
- TextNode updates only change text properties
- ImageNode updates only change image properties

## Do Not Change
- The simple existence checks in VisualMirrorComponent
- The 25 character limit logic in VisualMirrorText
- The independent rendering of each content type
- The merge behavior in useVisualMirrorStore

## Connection Rules
- Connection limitations (one node per type) are handled at the flowchart level, not in VisualMirror
- VisualMirror should always show whatever content is in the store
