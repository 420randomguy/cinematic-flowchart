# Git Operations Rules

## Force Push Only
- NEVER attempt to merge, rebase, or integrate remote changes with local changes
- ALWAYS force push local changes to replace remote completely when instructed
- DO NOT try to resolve conflicts between local and remote
- DO NOT perform git pull or git pull --rebase operations
- WHEN pushing to remote, use `git push -f` to force replace remote content

## Repository Cleaning
- When instructed to "clean" the repository, IMMEDIATELY force push local version
- DO NOT suggest or attempt conflict resolution
- The local version is ALWAYS considered the correct version
